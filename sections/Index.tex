\section{The $\avats$ Framework}\label{sec:cheetahtraj}
Recall that our goal is to provide high quality trajectory visualization for any user selected region query with low latency.
In this section, we first introduce the motivation behind the $\avats$ framework, then present its two key procedures: \textit{index building}, and \textit{query processing}.

\stitle{Motivation of $\avats$}
Given a user selected region query $\query$, a naive visualization procedure with our sampling algorithms works as follows:
it first retrieves all trajectories (or trajectory segments) that are in this region (a.k.a, $\wpts$ query~\cite{kruger2013trajectorylenses}),
then it invokes $\vatss$ (or $\vats$) to obtain a set $\oR$ of sample trajectories, and finally the trajectories in $\oR$ are rendered to the canvas (e.g., displaying device) as the visualization result.
$\vatss$ has short \textit{visualization time} as it effectively reduces the number of processed locations by sampling. However, $\vatss$ has a long \textit{sampling time} (e.g., several seconds to tens of seconds) even with our performance optimization techniques.
Hence, the naive procedure can not achieve low latency for large-scale trajectory visualization. To tackle this problem, we propose the $\avats$ framework as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:framework}.  $\avats$ consists of three modules: (i) \textsf{index building}, (ii) \textsf{query processing}, and (iii) \textsf{result visualization}, we elaborate them as follows.


%Motivate by this, we proposed $\avats$, which provides high quality trajectory visualization for any user query region efficiently.

\subsection{Index Building}~\label{sec:index}
The key idea of $\avats$ is to conduct $\vatss$ sampling in the offline \emph{index building} phase such that the sampling results can be used directly for online visualization.
Specifically, we propose an inverted list augmented quad-tree index ($\invQ$) to handle arbitrary query region.

As shown in the example $\invQ$-tree index $\II$ at the bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:framework}, we exploit a quad-tree to recursively partition the entire area (spanned by the trajectory dataset) into smaller areas and manage each area with a tree node.
For each tree node, we run $\vatss$ using the trajectories (or trajectory segments) in its associated area as input to compute the \textit{visualization quality inverted lists} for this area. $\mathcal{L}_0$ and $\mathcal{L}_{64}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:framework} are two example visualization quality inverted lists, in which the subscripts are the values of $\delta$ for this list.
Specifically, we compute several inverted lists with different $\delta$ values\footnote{We set $\delta$ as 0 (i.e., $\vats$), 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. We need quality inverted lists with different $\delta$ for one area as the area may be covered by query regions of different sizes, and we use lists with larger $\delta$ for larger query region as discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:VQGS+}.} to support the efficient quality guaranteed result visualization at various zoom levels.
For each inverted list, (i) $\vatss$ terminates until the quality of the sample set is $100\%$, i.e., the visualization result of the sample set is the same as the full dataset;
(ii) the trajectory selected at each iteration of $\vatss$ is stored in the inverted list with its \textit{cumulative quality} in ascending order. Take inverted list $\mathcal{L}_0$ in Figure~\ref{fig:framework} for example, $t_{i4}$ is the trajectory selected at the $4$th iteration,
$t_{i4}$'s cumulative quality is $0.23\%$, which means that the quality achieved by $\{t_{i1}, t_{i2}, t_{i3}, t_{i4}\}$ as a whole is $0.23\%$. With the quality inverted list, searching a quality guaranteed sample set for a query region can be conducted efficiently via binary search.


\subsection{Query Processing}~\label{sec:query}
For a region visualization query $\query$ with quality threshold $\tau$, Algorithm~\ref{alg:query} summarizes the $\mathsf{Query}$ subroutine, which finds a quality guaranteed trajectory sample set $\oR$. The algorithm starts by invoking $\mathsf{Query}(\query, \tau, \II.root, \oR=\emptyset)$, i.e., from the root of $\invQ$-tree index $\II$ with an empty result set $\oR$. Then Algorithm~\ref{alg:query} transverses the tree nodes recursively. If node   $\mathcal{N}$ is a leaf node or its associated area is entirely contained in the query region, we retrieve a quality guaranteed trajectory set by calling subroutine $\mathsf{findRet}()$, which conducts binary search on the proper inverted list in $\mathcal{N}$ (Line~\ref{line:ret}). Otherwise, we call $\mathsf{Query}()$ on the four children nodes of $\mathcal{N}$ ( Line~\ref{line:valls}-\ref{line:valle}).


\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{$\mathsf{Query}$($\query$, $\tau$, $\invQ$ node $\mathcal{N}$, result $\oR$)}
	\label{alg:query}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \If{ $\mathcal{N}$ is leaf node or  $\mathcal{N}$ is entirely contained in $\query$}
            \State $\oR \leftarrow \oR \cup \mathsf{findRet}(\mathcal{N}, \tau)$ \label{line:ret}
        \ElsIf {$\query \cap \mathcal{N} \neq \emptyset$} \label{line:valls}
            \For { $i$ from $0$ to $3$}
                \State $\mathsf{tmpQ} \leftarrow \query \cap \mathcal{N}.child[i]$
                \State $\mathsf{Query}(\mathsf{tmpQ}, \tau, \mathcal{N}.child[i], \oR)$
            \EndFor \label{line:valle}
        \EndIf
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Some trajectories in $\oR$, the result returned by $\mathsf{Query}()$ for region $\query$, may have segments outside $\mathcal{Q}$,
we conduct a way point query $\wpts(\query, \oR)$ to filter these segments before visualization.
%

\stitle{Correctness analysis}
We first show that $\avats$ meets the visualization quality requirement in Theorem~\ref{theorem:quality} as follows.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:quality}
If all selected nodes in the $\invQ$-tree index $\II$ are entirely contained in the query region $\query$,
then the result set $\oR$ returned by Algorithm~\ref{alg:query} satisfies that $\QQ(\oR) \ge \tau$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose query region $\query$ selects areas $\mathcal{A}_1,\!\mathcal{A}_2,\!\cdots,\!\mathcal{A}_K$,
these areas satisfy $\mathcal{A}_i \cap \mathcal{A}_j = \emptyset$ for $i\neq j$, and $\cup_{k=1}^{K}\mathcal{A}_k=\mathcal{Q}$.
For each area $\mathcal{A}_k$, denote the number of points marked in the ground truth visualization as $n_k$,
and the number of points marked by the trajectories in $\mathcal{R}$ as $m_k$,
we have $\frac{m_k}{n_k} \ge \tau$ as we use the visualization quality inverted index for trajectory selection.
Thus, for query region $\query$ with result set $\oR$, we have
$\QQ(\oR) = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K} m_k}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} n_k} \ge \tau.$
\end{proof}
In more general cases, we also select some areas that only intersect with the query region $\query$ and the sample set $\oR$ may not satisfy $\frac{m_k}{n_k}\ge \tau$ for these areas.
This does not significantly affect visualization quality for two reasons:
(i) these areas are the leaf nodes of the $\invQ$-tree index and thus reside on the border of the query region.
When exploring the map, human tends to move the region of interest to the screen center, where is more ``close'' to eyes~\cite{fitts_click}. %fitts,
%It is well known human eyes are much more sensitive to the center of a visualization than to the border, a.k.a., the fish eye effect~\cite{xxx};
(ii) the areas of the border regions are small w.r.t. the query region if the $\invQ$-tree has a sufficient height (i.e., the leaf nodes have a small area).

%In the worst case, we could include all the trajectories in the border regions into the result region $\oR$ to let them satisfy the quality requirement $\tau$.

%By searching the $\invQ$-tree index, $\vatss$ obtains a quality guaranteed sample trajectory set $\oR$ for any query region $\query$ without conducting on-line sampling. The \textit{result visualization} can process $\oR$ for short visualization latency.

%Note that we do not use the $\invQ$-tree index when the query region is too small (e.g., with zoom level larger than 17) because there are only a small number of trajectories and visualizing all of them does not take a long time.


%In summary, the $\vatss$ framework exploits the proposed $\invQ$-tree index and query processing subroutine $\mathsf{Query}$ to provide high quality trajectory visualization for any user region query with low latency.

%and (ii) The areas of the border regions are small w.r.t. the query region if the height of $\invQ$-tree index is large enough, which is shown in the following Lemma.

%\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:size}
%If the query region $\query$ is an $L\times L$ square and the leaf areas in the quad-tree has a size $l\times l$, then the border regions takes up at most $\frac{4(L-1)l}{L^2}$ of the overall area of the query region.
%\end{lemma}

%The result of Lemma~\ref{lemma:size} also generalize to rectangle query region and quad-tree areas. We omit its proof as it is straightforward. In the implementation, we use $\mathsf{Full}$ if the query region satisfies $L< 32*l$ because the query region is small and visualizing all trajectories in it does not take too much time. In this case, we ensure that the border regions that does not satisfy the quality requirement takes at most 12.1\% of the area of the query region.

%To motivate $\avats$, we analyze the visualization results and processing time of three solutions in Figure~\ref{fig:motivate} and Table~\ref{tab:motivate}, respectively.
%All three baselines use a \textit{way point query} to find the (segments of) trajectories in the query region as the first step.
%$\full$ visualizes all trajectories in the query region, $\rand$ randomly selects 1\% of the trajectories in the query region while $\vatss$ uses $\vatss$ (with $\delta=8$) to sample 1\% of the trajectories in the query region.
%In Table~\ref{tab:motivate}, we report the number of processed location points (i.e., via screen point mapping and rendering) in the bracket after visualization time.

%We can make the following observations from Figure~\ref{fig:motivate} and Table~\ref{tab:motivate}: (1) $\vatss$ provides visualization results very similar to $\mathsf{Full}$ and effectively reduces the visual clutter of $\mathsf{Full}$ in dense regions. In contrast, the visualization result of $\mathsf{Random}$ is significantly different from $\mathsf{Full}$. Although $\mathsf{Random}$ has a short total time, its poor quality renders it inapplicable. (2) $\mathsf{Full}$ has a long visualization time due to processing too many location points. $\vatss$ has short visualization time as it effectively reduces the number of processed locations by sampling. But it spends a long time to conduct sampling, which also results in a long total time. Therefore, the key insight of $\avats$ to conduct $\vatss$ sampling in  the offline index building phase such that the sampling results can be used directly for online visualization.



%The index building and query processing procedures of $\avats$ are described in Algorithm~\ref{alg:local index} and Algorithm~\ref{alg:local query}, respectively.
%For index building,  Algorithm~\ref{alg:local index} uses a quad-tree to recursively partition the entire area into smaller areas and manages each area with a tree node. For each area $\mathcal{A}$, Algorithm~\ref{alg:local index} builds a \textit{visualization quality inverted index} $\mathsf{Inv}(\mathcal{A})$ for the trajectories in it. Specifically, in each iteration of $\vatss$, we choose a trajectory $t_i$ and calculate the visualization quality $q_i$ achieved by all trajectories sampled so far. We arrange the $(t_i, q_i)$ tuples in increasing order of $q_i$ in $\mathsf{Inv}(\mathcal{A})$, i.e., store the trajectories sampled in earlier iterations of $\vatss$ at first in the array. Thus, searching the trajectories that meet a quality requirement $q$ for area $\mathcal{A}$ can be conducted via a binary search.
