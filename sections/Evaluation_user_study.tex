In this part, we conduct a user study to evaluate the quality of visualizations generated by different methods objectively.

\stitle{Settings}
We recruited 35 participants with 10 females, 25 males, aged 19 to 31 with a mean of 24.78 for the user study. 
The user study is conducted on the \pt{} and \sz{} datasets, and four visualization methods are investigated, i.e., $\full$, $\rand$, $\mathsf{DTW}$ and $\avats$. We manually select 22 \textit{center points} in the two datasets and define 3 \textit{visualization scales} including:
large-scale region (with zoom level smaller than 13), middle-scale region (with zoom level between 13 and 15), small-scale region (with zoom level larger than 15). For each center point and at each visualization scale, we generate a \textit{comparable visualization group}, which includes one visualization generated by each of the 4 methods. This results in 66 comparable groups (22 center points $\times$ 3 scales) and 264 visualization results (66 comparable groups $\times$ 4 visualizations).

We are interested in the visual quality and visual clutter of the visualizations, and hence designed three tasks for a comparable group:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Task 1 (T1): rank the visualizations in a group from the highest visual quality to the lowest visual quality by 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.
	\item Task 2 (T2): rank the visualizations in a group from the least visual clutter to the most severe visual clutter by 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.
	\item Task 3 (T3): select the visualizations considered acceptable (multiple choices allowed) and choose the reason for the visualizations considered unacceptable. We provide three reasons including ``severe visual clutter", ``poor visual quality" and ``others".
\end{itemize}

The user study system is a web-based platform, in which all visualizations are displayed with a resolution of 450*300.


\stitle{User study procedure} When the participants enter the user study system, they are given a tutorial on how to conduct the tasks to get familiar with the interface and tasks.
For each participant, we randomly select 16 comparable groups.
Thus, we obtain $35 \times 16 = 560$ results for each task.
For each comparable group, the 4 visualizations (\textit{without specifying generated by which method}) in it are displayed on the same web-page and a participant is required to perform task T1, T2 and T3 by inspecting them.

%At last, the participants are interviewed to collect feedback after finishing the study and their answers are saved for result analysis.



\stitle{Result analysis} Figure~\ref{fig:userstudy}(A) reports the visual quality ranking of the 4 methods in T1. 
The results show that $\full$ ranks the 1st in most cases while $\avats$ usually ranks 1st or 2nd, i.e., the percentage of $\avats$ ranks top-2 among 4 methods is $88.9\%$. 
In contrast, $\mathsf{DTW}$ and $\rand$ rank 3rd and 4th at most times. 
This suggests that the visualizations generated by $\avats$ are more appealing to the participants than $\mathsf{DTW}$ and $\rand$. 
We also observed that the participants tend to rank $\avats$ before $\full$ for large-scale regions with  many trajectories, and the other way for smaller regions. 


Figure~\ref{fig:userstudy}(B) reports the anti-visual clutter ranking of the 4 methods in T2. 
The results show that visual clutter is most severe for $\full$, ranking 4th in most cases (349 over 560). With sampling, $\mathsf{DTW}$ usually rank 2nd and 3rd but $\rand$ ranks 4th for a considerable number of times as it tends to create clutter in the dense regions.    
$\avats$ is the most successful in reducing visual clutter, ranking 1st in 255 out of the 560 cases and ranking 4th for only 19 cases.    



We report the frequency each of the 4 methods is selected as acceptable and why a method is not selected in T3 using bar chart in Figure~\ref{fig:userstudy}(C). 
Each column corresponds to a method, and from bottom to top, the lengths of the bars indicate the percentage of participants choosing ``acceptable'', ``not acceptable due to visual clutter'', ``not acceptable due to poor visual quality'' and ``not acceptable for other reasons''. 
The results show that $\avats$ is regarded acceptable for about 88.2\% of the cases, and the other methods have significantly lower acceptance rate than $\avats$. 
Specifically, $\mathsf{DTW}$ and $\rand$ have low acceptance rate mainly due to poor visual quality while $\full$ suffers from severe visual clutter.


%Figure~\ref{fig:rank} left shows the ranking among different methods with x-axis indicating the ranking from the highest quality to the lowest quality and y-axis indicating the selecting number for the specific method and ranking. The visualization of $\full$ has the highest visual quality since it has no information loss according the quality definition. The selection of $\avats$ is mostly concentrated at the first and second, which is closely behind the $\full$. The selections of $\baseline$ and $\rand$ are contracted at the third and fourth respectively, which is confirmed both of these two methods performs worse than $\full$ and $\qtavats$ in guarantee the visual quality.



%Figure~\ref{fig:rank} right reports the ranking among different methods with x-axis indicating the ranking from the least clutter to the most clutter and y-axis indicating the total selecting number for the specific method and ranking. We observe that the $\qtavats$ is ranked at the first 155 times which is significantly more than the other methods. The number it ranks at the second, third and last are 68, 96 and 14. There is no doubt that the visualization of $full$ suffers the most sever visual clutter problem because 210 of 333 total answers rank $full$ at the fourth, while other methods can be used to help to reduce the visual clutter.
